        Storyboarding</h1>
      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4"> Background </h2>
      <p> For this project, I observed and researched how CVS customers interact
        with the self-checkout station interface. I then brainstormed personas
        based on my user research and created a storyboard to depict the user
        journey. </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Self-Checkout Station Diagram</h2>
      <img class="img-fluid max-width: 70% mx-auto d-block mt-3 mb-3"

        diagram">
      <p> Users place all items to be purchased in the area left of the scanner
        and scan each item one by one. Users can interact with the display in
        order to request help from an employee, proceed to the payment process,
        change the language, etc. Once all the items have been scanned and are
        in the bagging area, users pay by using the card reader. </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Observations and User Research</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> User Observations</h4>
      <li> Users did not put their items to be scanned in the intended area to
        the left of the scanner </li>
      <li> Users were able to scan items on their first try without issues </li>
      <li> Some users interacted with the payment screen to select their payment
        method before swiping their credit/debit cards, while others ignored it
        and just paid immediately </li>
      <li> Two users forgot to place items in the bagging area to the right of
        scanner, prompting a CVS employee to come over and help</li>
      <p> </p>
      <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> User Research Questions</h4>
      <ol type="1">
        <li> Why did you choose the self-checkout station instead of the
          cashier-checkout station? </li>
        <li> Did the self-checkout station interface perform as you expected? If
          not, which parts were confusing? </li>
        <li> What were the easiest and hardest tasks to accomplish using the
          interface? </li>
        <li> How did you feel while using the self-checkout station? </li>
      </ol>
      <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Summary of Responses</h4>
      <li> Users chose the self-checkout station because they thought it would
        be quicker than waiting in line for a cashier-checkout station</li>
      <li> One user felt uncomfortable using the self-checkout station because
        they accidentally made a mistake, prompting a CVS employee to check on
        them </li>
      <li> Users generally found scanning each item to be the easiest task and
        placing their items in the correct place to be the hardest</li>
      <li> Users felt nervous about scanning items incorrectly, as there was no
        clear way to undo an item scanned by mistake on the display </li>
      <li> Users were confused with the payment process, as the instructions on
        the station display did not match the ones given on the card reader
      </li>
      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Personas</h2>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
        <div class="col-sm justify-content-center">
          <h4 class="text-center"> Rushed Student </h4>
          <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block mt-3 mb-3"
            src="./assets/rushed-student.png" alt="Rushed student persona">
          <p> The rushed student takes five classes at Brown University and
            is getting toiletries and snacks for their dorm. This user struggles
            with placing items in the correct area of the self-checkout station
            and starting the payment process on the display. This persona
            represents users I observed who were in a hurry and hoping to use
            the self-checkout station so that they could leave the store
            quicker. They also represent users who struggled with misplacing
            items or forgetting to scan items due to their rushed interaction
            with the interface. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm justify-content-center">
          <h4 class="text-center"> Cautious Shopper </h4>
          <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block mt-3 mb-3"
            src="./assets/cautious-shopper.png" alt="Cautious shopper persona">
          <p> The cautious shopper lives walking distance from CVS and has a
            list of items they want to buy after doing research online. This
            user primarily struggles with figuring out how to undo mistakenly
            scanned items and selecting a payment method. This persona
            represents users I interviewed who were nervous about using the
            self-checkout station due to concerns that they would be flagged for
            stealing items, when in reality they were just confused with the
            interface. This persona also represents users who were hesitant to
            use the self-checkout station in case they needed help or made a
            mistake. </p>
